# Legal issues on LLM in games

## 

## Can you publish a game with LLM-generated content on Steam?
Check this [Steam Article](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618). TLDR: you can, but you should report to Steam the measure you took to prevent  illegal contents, for both pre-generated text and live-generated text. This [reddit post] summarizes it as
```
you can have your game generate LMM content at runtime. There are two caveats:

    * You cannot have runtime-generated "adult-only sexual content"

    * You must tell Steam what guards/checks you have against "generating illegal content"

    * (Whatever you tell Steam will probably appear on your store page.)

    * (This implies you must write some sanity-checking code. A simple keyword blacklist on user input would probably suffice.)
